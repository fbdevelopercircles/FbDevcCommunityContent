## Simple-bot

The bot was written quickly in few hours.

At first `computer_cell_bot.py` used to have all the functions. It gets messy, so the bot core was isolated from the discord API in `corpora.py` (making the bot platform independent).

This migration is not complete

(corpora) ---> (discord api)
